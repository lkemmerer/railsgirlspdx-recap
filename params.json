Even though we only had a an evening and a day to introduce you to Rails, we talked about a lot of different things.  Hopefully the stuff found below will be helpful as you continue to learn about Ruby on Rails and developing web applications!\r\n\r\nThis recap doesn't cover installing Rails, since after the event, you should already have it installed.  I've linked liberally to a site called [Skillcrush](http://skillcrush.com/), which defines tech terms using non-technical language.\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\nBefore getting started on our first Rails app, there are a few tools with which we need to be familiar\r\n### Command Prompt\r\nThe command prompt is a text-only program that allows you to interact with your operating system.  We use it to go to different places (directories) on your hard drive, to start our Rails [web server](http://skillcrush.com/2012/07/03/web-server-2/), and to run other commands.  Since this group was almost all Windows users, the commands and instructions in this section are for Windows.\r\n\r\n**In order to open your command prompt**\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Start Menu.\r\n\r\n2. Search for _Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails_ and select it.\r\n\r\n3. This opens up the command prompt and usually puts you in the `C:\\Sites` folder on your hard drive.\r\n\r\n**There are a few commands that we used regularly during our meetup**\r\n\r\n * `dir` lists all the folders and files in the current directory you are in.\r\n   It's equivalent to opening up your Windows Explorer and seeing all the icons/pictures for the folders and documents you have -- only it's all text.\r\n * `cd` will change your current directory (folder).\r\n   For example, to go from `C:\\Sites` to `C:\\Sites\\new_app` (if that were your Rails app), you would type `cd new_app`.  To go back to `C:\\Sites` you would type `cd ..` -- the `..` means go up one directory.\r\n\r\n**Try this**: let's navigate to the blogs app that we created and look at what files and directories are in the app. (at the end of each line below, press enter!)\r\n```````````````\r\ncd C:\\Sites\\blogs\r\ndir\r\n```````````````\r\nYou should see a few directories and files like the ones below -- often, if you see a `.` in the name, it means it is a file (though that's not always true!)\r\n```````````````\r\napp\r\nconfig\r\nconfig.ru <-- file\r\ndb\r\ndoc\r\nGemfile <-- also a file !\r\nGemfile.lock\r\nlib\r\nlog\r\npublic\r\nRakefile <-- file !\r\nREADME.rdoc <-- file that most apps have that often explains to other programmers what the app does\r\nscript\r\ntest\r\ntmp\r\nvendor\r\n```````````````\r\n\r\nWe'll cover Rails-specific commands for the command prompt later on, once we go over creating a Rails app.\r\n\r\n### Text editor (Komodo)\r\n### Browser\r\n\r\n## Concepts\r\n* Ruby\r\n* Gems\r\n* Ruby on Rails\r\n* Models, Views, and Controllers\r\n\r\n## Do stuff!\r\n* Creating a new Rails app\r\n* Generating a Scaffold for Blog Entry functionality\r\n* Adding a new Gem (twitter-bootstrap-rails\r\n* Modifying your views\r\n\r\n# Topics we mentioned:\r\n* Renaming your app\r\n* JSON and Hashes\r\n* Sending emails with Rails","name":"RailsGirls PDX recap","google":""}

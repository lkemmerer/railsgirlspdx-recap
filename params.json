{"body":"# Topics we covered\r\nOn September 7-8th, [RailsGirls PDX](http://railsgirls.com/portland) happened so women could learn about Ruby on Rails and meet other women interested in doing the same.  Even though we only had a an evening and a day to introduce you to Rails, we talked about a lot of different things.  Hopefully the stuff found below will be helpful as you continue to learn about Ruby on Rails and developing web applications!\r\n\r\nThis recap doesn't cover installing Rails, since after the event, you should already have it installed.  I've linked liberally to a site called [Skillcrush](http://skillcrush.com/), which defines tech terms using non-technical language.\r\n\r\n## Other, more in-depth resources and help\r\n* [Rails Girls App Tutorial](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/): instructions on how to set up a Blog app\r\n* [Ruby on Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html): getting started (this is slightly technical)\r\n* [Portland Ruby Brigade Beginner's Meetups](http://pdxruby.org/): a once-monthly gathering where Ruby experts are happy to help\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\nBefore getting started on our first Rails app, there are a few tools with which we need to be familiar\r\n* **Command Prompt**  \r\nThe command prompt is a text-only program that allows you to interact with your operating system.

When you run `rails s`, this is where you'll go to see your app!\r\n\r\n## Concepts\r\n* **Ruby**  \r\nA [programming language](http://skillcrush.com/2012/04/05/programming-languages/) that's easy for humans to understand.  It's the language that we used to create our blog app during RailsGirls.  \r\n[Learn more...](https://github.com/lkemmerer/railsgirlspdx-recap/wiki/Ruby)\r\n\r\n* **Gems**  \r\nGems are a collection of Ruby code that are meant to do one (or sometimes more) things well so that you don't have to write your own code to do the same thing.  \r\n[Learn more...](https://github.com/lkemmerer/railsgirlspdx-recap/wiki/Ruby-Gems)\r\n\r\n* **Ruby on Rails**\r\n* **Models, Views, and Controllers**\r\n\r\n## Do stuff!\r\n* **Creating a new Rails app**\r\n* **Generating a Scaffold for Blog Entry functionality**\r\n* **Adding a new Gem (twitter-bootstrap-rails)**\r\n* **Modifying your views**\r\n\r\n## Topics we mentioned\r\n* **Hashes and JSON**\r\n* **[AJAX](http://skillcrush.com/2012/04/18/ajax/), [REST](http://skillcrush.com/2012/07/13/rest/), and [APIs](http://skillcrush.com/2012/07/04/api-2/)**\r\n* **Renaming your app**\r\n* **Sending emails with Rails**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

        <h1>Topics we covered</h1>

<p>On September 7-8th, <a href="http://railsgirls.com/portland">RailsGirls PDX</a> happened so women could learn about Ruby on Rails and meet other women interested in doing the same.  Even though we only had a an evening and a day to introduce you to Rails, we talked about a lot of different things.  Hopefully the stuff found below will be helpful as you continue to learn about Ruby on Rails and developing web applications!</p>

<p>This recap doesn't cover installing Rails, since after the event, you should already have it installed.  I've linked liberally to a site called <a href="http://skillcrush.com/">Skillcrush</a>, which defines tech terms using non-technical language.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Before getting started on our first Rails app, there are a few tools with which we need to be familiar</p>

<h3>Command Prompt</h3>

<p>The command prompt is a text-only program that allows you to interact with your operating system.  We use it to go to different places (directories) on your hard drive, to start our Rails <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/07/03/web-server-2/">web server</a>, and to run other commands.  Since this group was almost all Windows users, the commands and instructions in this section are for Windows.</p>

<p><strong>In order to open your command prompt</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to the Start Menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Search for <em>Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails</em> and select it.</p></li>
<li><p>This opens up the command prompt and usually puts you in the <code>C:\Sites</code> folder on your hard drive.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>There are a few commands that we used regularly during our meetup</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>dir</code> lists all the folders and files in the current directory you are in.
It's equivalent to opening up your Windows Explorer and seeing all the icons/pictures for the folders and documents you have -- only it's all text.</li>
<li>
<code>cd</code> will change your current directory (folder).
For example, to go from <code>C:\Sites</code> to <code>C:\Sites\new_app</code> (if that were your Rails app), you would type <code>cd new_app</code>.  To go back to <code>C:\Sites</code> you would type <code>cd ..</code> -- the <code>..</code> means go up one directory.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Try this</strong>: let's navigate to the blogs app that we created and look at what files and directories are in the app. (at the end of each line below, press enter!)</p>

<pre><code>cd C:\Sites\blogs
dir
</code></pre>

<p>You should see a few directories and files like the ones below -- often, if you see a <code>.</code> in the name, it means it is a file (though that's not always true!)</p>

<pre><code>app
config
config.ru &lt;-- file
db
doc
Gemfile &lt;-- also a file !
Gemfile.lock
lib
log
public
Rakefile &lt;-- file !
README.rdoc &lt;-- file that most apps have that often explains to other programmers what the app does
script
test
tmp
vendor
</code></pre>

<p>We'll cover Rails-specific commands for the command prompt later on, once we go over creating a Rails app.</p>
